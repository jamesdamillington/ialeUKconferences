# Overview and Summary

This is a collection of analyses of conference abstracts from 25 years of ialeUK conferences. Analysis is ongoing.  

A summary of initial observations is shown below. 

Use the table of contents (e.g. in the panel on the left) to navigate to detailed analysis (currently line and bar charts).  

*Suggestions for additional analysis*
- For some themes, categories for 'undefined' abstracts have sometimes been removed from analysis; need to provide information on how removing these 'undefined' studies includences the number of abstracts in the analysis. 
- Other suggestions for quant analyses welcome


[add links below later to specific sections]

## Summary: Abstracts though time

- General increase through time to early 2000s then drop but steady through 2010s
- NGO attendance has replaced declines in Government? (could check sum of Gov + NGO through time)
- Empirical studies have decreased through time while GIS and qualitative have increased through time
- Global studies only appear from 2014 onwards

## Summary: Author affiliation

- Academic contributors dominate, followed by Government (but as shown above, Government contributions have decreased recently, replaced by NGOs)
- Business contributors have noticeably lower proportion of empirical studies (expensive?) than other author types, substituted by GIS and qualitative
- Government and NGOs have greater proportion of Management and Conservation than Academic

## Summary: Landscape Type

- Lowland rural landscape studies dominate, followed by 'undefined' and Upland rural
- Seascape studies have largest proportion of qualitative methods
- Urban landscape studies are dominated by Local scale analysis
- Upland rural have larger proportion of national studies than Lowland rural
- Unsurprisingly, Green Infrastructure has greatest proportion in Urban landscapes and catchment-based approaches in Riverscapes
- Little study of cultural landscapes in Urban areas


## Summary: Organism

- Amphibians, Fish, Reptiles are little studied
- Plants have greatest proportions of longer studies (Decadal and Centuries) while Inverts have greatest proportion of shorter studies (Annual and Monthly) - makes sense given rates of change and life history of these organisms? 
- Businesses and private individuals largely study humans (based on proportional data)
- By absolute numbers NGOs dominate study of birds 
- Humans dominated by qualitative studies, with few empirical (i.e. few interviews, questionnaires?)
- Possibly surprisingly, plants do not have many RS studies
- Inverts dominated by 'mini' spatial extent studies
