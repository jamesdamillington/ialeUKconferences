# Overview

Collection of analyses of conference abstracts at 25 years of ialeUK conferences 

Use table of contents (e.g. in the panel on the left) to navigate the book. 

*Suggestions for additional analysis*
- For some themes, categories for 'undefined' abstracts have sometimes been removed from analysis; need to provide information on how removing these 'undefined' studies includences the number of abstracts in the analysis. 


# Summary of Initial Quick Observations [add links later]

## Abstracts though time

- General increase through time to early 2000s then drop but steady through 2010s
- NGO attendance has replaced declines in Government? (could check sum of Gov + NGO through time)
- Empirical studies have decreased through time while GIS and qualitative have increased through time
- Global studies only appear from 2014 onwards

## Species

- Plants have greatest proportions of longer studies (Decadal and Centuries) while Inverts have greatest proportion of shorter studies (Annual and Monthly) - makes sense given rates of change and life history of these organisms?
